# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Sandbox Prototype

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Sandbox! This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic movie recommendation engine using a hands-on, exploratory approach.

## 📘 About the Project

This notebook is a part of a prototype project designed to simulate how personalized movie recommendations can be generated using structured movie datasets. It offers a guided walkthrough on:

- Exploring a movie dataset
- Computing similarity between movies
- Recommending movies based on genres, keywords, and metadata
- Using content-based recommendation techniques

The goal is to illustrate the foundational logic behind recommender systems in a readable and reproducible Jupyter Notebook format.

## 🧰 Features

- 📊 Data exploration and preprocessing
- 📌 TF-IDF based content similarity
- 🔁 Cosine similarity for movie matching
- 🧠 Genre + metadata-based hybrid logic
- 🧪 Modular experimentation environment
